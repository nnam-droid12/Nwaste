              As NWASTE  is committed to keeping to its future plan which is zero hunger in 2030, we plan to help farmers with crop data decision, what deos this mean? Based on the crop the farmer wish to plant in aparticular season, farmers get to know if their crop is compartible with the soil type and weather condition before, during and after planting. But for the mean time our solution solely address soil type, current weather condition, forecast and historical weather data.
